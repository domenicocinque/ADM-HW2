# Homework 2 - eCommerce analytics

This repository contains the files for the HW2. The `main.ipynb` file contains the answers organized in sections.

## Before we start
In order to excecute the code on all the months we did all the computation on a *AWS-EC2* instance. We did some useful and computationally expensive operations on the dataset and we saved the results with the `pickle` format provided by Python. This allowed us to load faster the objects, not overcharge the RAM memory and avoid kernel shutdown. Some of the operation that we performed outside the notebook are:
- dividing the `category_code
date
3 dataframe 1 con groupby e non duplicati
tolto duplicati sessioni 
tutto su s3
